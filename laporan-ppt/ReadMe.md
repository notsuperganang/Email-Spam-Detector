   Visual elements in the original design may be lost during the export, leading to changes in appearance and the loss of specific details.

2. **Loss of Font Styles:**
   The font styles used in the original design may not appear correctly after export to PowerPoint, causing layout changes and text aesthetic alterations.

3. **Reduction in Aesthetic Quality:**
   During the conversion to PowerPoint format, there is a possibility of a decrease in aesthetic quality, such as color, proportions, or other visual effects that may not transfer entirely.
